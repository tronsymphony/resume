This website uses the file menuslide.js to create a sliding navigation that is desktop and mobile ready. It can be dragged and clicked on to active. 

mainscript-frontpageslider.js Is also used on this site to create the draggable sliding slider on the frontpage. These two plugins are using the hammer.js library to help with this functionality. 
I've only included the JS files and not the php,css,or html that are also used.
